<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>If a “bonus” is <strong>discretionary</strong> <em>and</em> gated by language like <strong>“satisfactory performance, as solely determined by the Company”</strong>, you should treat it as <strong>optional</strong>—even if everyone has good intentions.</p>

<p>The goal isn’t to “win” a fight. The goal is to remove <strong>unbounded discretion</strong> and align incentives with reality.</p>

<p>What works:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Treat the agreement like an engineering spec: define terms, acceptance criteria, and failure modes.</li>
  <li>Separate <strong>your performance</strong> from <strong>external outcomes</strong> (fundraising, market conditions).</li>
  <li>Replace subjective clauses with <strong>objective triggers</strong> (KPIs/OKRs + “good faith” standards).</li>
  <li>If legal edits take time, offer a pragmatic near-term path (base comp + work structure) without calling it a “fallback”.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="1-why-discretionary-bonus-agreements-break">1) Why discretionary bonus agreements break</h2>

<p>Discretionary bonus agreements are common in startups because they preserve flexibility. That’s fine—until the agreement is written in a way that makes payment <strong>non-obligatory in practice</strong>, even when the business outcome happens.</p>

<h3 id="the-stacking-veto-pattern-the-real-problem">The stacking-veto pattern (the real problem)</h3>

<p>The most dangerous structure is not one clause—it’s a <strong>stack</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>funding event must close</li>
  <li>a certain threshold must be met (sometimes undefined)</li>
  <li>you must be employed through the payment date</li>
  <li>“satisfactory performance” (undefined)</li>
  <li>“good standing” (undefined)</li>
  <li>no “bad leaver” conditions (often broad)</li>
  <li>written approval by one person</li>
</ul>

<p>Any single veto = <strong>$0</strong>.</p>

<p>If your agreement looks like this, it’s not a performance incentive. It’s a <strong>permission slip</strong> the company can revoke.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2-red-flags-to-look-for-before-you-sign">2) Red flags to look for before you sign</h2>

<p>Here are clause patterns that deserve a second read (or a redline). Each may be acceptable in isolation; the risk is when it’s <strong>unbounded</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="3-the-single-best-sentence-to-include">3) The single best sentence to include</h2>

<p>This one sentence prevents a very common trap:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>“I want to explicitly separate individual performance from fundraising outcomes, which are ultimately driven by market conditions and investor decisions rather than execution alone.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s calm, factual, and it blocks “fundraising result = your performance” narratives later.</p>

<p>Think of the agreement like an API:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Undefined terms</strong> are undefined behavior.</li>
  <li><strong>One-person discretion</strong> is a non-deterministic dependency.</li>
  <li><strong>Stacked vetoes</strong> are failure points.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your goal isn’t to remove discretion. It’s to remove <strong>unbounded discretion</strong>.</p>

  <li>“as solely determined”</li>
  <li>“harms the Company’s interests”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Better language</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>“assessed in good faith”</li>
  <li>“based on mutually agreed objectives (KPIs/OKRs) documented in writing”</li>
  <li>“approval not unreasonably withheld if conditions are met”</li>
  <li>“bad leaver limited to fraud, willful misconduct, or material intentional breach”</li>

<p><strong>Add</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>“Bad Leaver applies only in cases of <strong>fraud, willful misconduct, or material intentional breach</strong>.”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="6-if-legal-edits-take-time-offer-a-pragmatic-near-term-path-without-fallback-language">6) If legal edits take time: offer a pragmatic near-term path (without “fallback” language)</h2>

<p>In practice, companies often resist rewriting legal language quickly.</p>

<p>If you need sustainability <strong>now</strong>, give leadership an “execution health” option that is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cheaper than a large bonus</li>
  <li>simple to approve</li>
  <li>immediate impact</li>
  <li>framed as operational, not emotional</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a base compensation adjustment to restore balance</li>
  <li>remote weekend support / reduced commute overhead</li>
  <li>clearer workload distribution expectations</li>
</ul>

<p>Avoid calling it a “fallback”. Call it a pragmatic near-term solution while longer-term alignment is addressed.</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Hi [Name],

Thank you for sharing the Executive Bonus Agreement.

I’m aligned with the intent, and I understand that fundraising outcomes depend on investors and market conditions, so I’m not expecting guarantees beyond what’s realistic for a startup.

Before signing, I’d like to clarify several points to ensure expectations are objective and aligned upfront. The documents were reviewed with counsel, and the same items were flagged as important to address directly in the agreement.

<span class="gu">## Context (why clarity matters)</span>

Over the past [X] months, I’ve made a substantial commitment to the company and accepted a meaningful compensation trade-off:
<span class="p">
-</span> Joined at <span class="gs">**[Base]**</span>, after previously earning <span class="gs">**[Prior]**</span> (including bonuses).
<span class="p">-</span> Sustained workload including nights/weekends to keep delivery unblocked across multiple teams.
<span class="p">-</span> Material opportunity cost and reduced total compensation over an extended period.

Given the sustained base-compensation reduction, the bonus functions as a component of total compensation rather than a discretionary perk, which is why clarity here is particularly important.

<span class="gu">## Points requiring clarification</span>

1) <span class="gs">**Funding target and valuation basis**</span>  
The tiers are anchored to a high funding threshold, but the agreement does not clarify how feasibility is determined.  
<span class="p">-</span> Is this benchmark based on third-party/independent valuation, investor guidance, or formal fundraising analysis?  
<span class="p">-</span> Or is it based solely on internal judgment?

Without an objective basis, it is possible for the market-supported outcome to fall into lower tiers or zero.

I want to explicitly separate individual performance from fundraising outcomes, which are ultimately driven by market conditions and investor decisions rather than execution alone.

2) <span class="gs">**“Satisfactory performance, as solely determined by the Company”**</span>  
In a bonus agreement tied to a material amount, this formulation is problematic. As written, performance is not measured against KPIs/OKRs and depends on a unilateral determination.

Assessment based on mutually agreed objectives or good-faith evaluation would be more consistent with executive-level incentives.

3) <span class="gs">**Bad Leaver / “harms the Company’s interests”**</span>  
I’d like to clarify how Bad Leaver is interpreted in situations driven by organizational or staffing decisions. If burnout or performance degradation results primarily from structural decisions, it would be concerning if such outcomes could be treated as unsatisfactory performance or “harm,” triggering forfeiture.

<span class="gu">## Closing — pragmatic options for alignment</span>

What I’m asking for is not guarantees, but clear, objective, and balanced terms consistent with executive-level incentives.

For me, alignment means that outcomes driven by market or organizational constraints are not later reinterpreted as individual performance failures.

For me to proceed, these clarifications need to be reflected directly in the agreement text.

If aligning on all bonus-related points takes more time, I see a pragmatic way to restore balance and keep execution healthy in the near term:
<span class="p">-</span> <span class="gs">**Base compensation adjustment**</span>: a meaningful increase to restore sustainability.
<span class="p">-</span> <span class="gs">**Remote weekend support**</span>: continue weekend support when needed, but remotely, to reduce non-productive overhead.

Thank you for taking the time to review this.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]

<h2 id="8-if-they-say-lets-discuss-on-a-call">8) If they say “let’s discuss on a call”</h2>

<p>Agree to the call, but keep it structured:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>“Happy to discuss live. It would help me if we could first align on which of the outlined paths feels most viable, so I can come prepared and keep the conversation focused.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is calm, not escalatory, and it prevents the “improv negotiation” trap.</p>

<h2 id="closing-thought">Closing thought</h2>

<p>Negotiating a discretionary bonus agreement isn’t about being difficult. It’s about doing what we already do as engineers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify ambiguity,</li>
  <li>define acceptance criteria,</li>
  <li>reduce undefined behavior,</li>
  <li>and align incentives with reality.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re carrying executive-level responsibility, your agreement should have executive-level clarity.</p>
