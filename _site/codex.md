It seems everything's mostly fine. The setup for the head's meta description is
in place, using `page.excerpt` or `site.description`, which is good. The domain
`lukin.io` with its CNAME file is also okay. However, there‚Äôs no `sitemap` plugi
n present, and the static `sitemap.xml` might be out of date, possibly missing n
ewer posts. This could limit Google's ability to discover content, although inte
rnal links should still help. I want to check `index.html` to confirm the presen
ce of blog links.

r problem: the canonical link uses `page.url`, which could be `/blog.html` or `/
blog`. If the URL is `/blog.html`, the canonical may end up looking like `https:
//lukin.io/blog.html`. There‚Äôs a concern about how GitHub Pages maps these URLs,
 potentially causing duplicate content issues due to this mismatch. Also, both `
/blog.html` and `/blog` are accessible.**Examining URL structure issues**

I‚Äôm considering how GitHub Pages creates "pretty" links; it looks like I need th

the `.html` extension outputs a URL of `/blog.html`, but navigating directly to
`/blog` might lead to a 404 error, which isn‚Äôt good! The sitemap shows `https://

**Evaluating Jekyll post layout**

ffecting indexing quality, though it can still index the body content.**Consider
ing search engine indexing**

I realize that without a proper `<title>`, the post title defaults to something
else, which could negatively impact indexing. The search engine expects a correc
tly structured title for optimal performance. On the bright side, I‚Äôve noticed t
hat the two other posts which have the 'post' layout set do include the necessar
y head tags. I need to ensure proper formatting for the compiled posts while con

**Identifying blog issues**

I've noticed that the blog listing uses `{{ post.url }}` correctly, linking to e
xtensionless paths, which is good. However, there are a few major issues:

The static sitemap is missing proper posts and has incorrect last modified dates
. Also, the duplicated `<title>` tags harm indexing and should be made unique. A
 few includes have extra spaces, creating sloppy links. One post lacks `layout:
post`, risking Google treating it as low quality. Lastly, the canonical link for
 `blog.html` mismatches with the sitemap. I should create a concise report outli
ning these findings and solutions.**Updating analysis plan**

The user requested an analysis of Ruby's blog, so I need to present the results
and propose fixes sorted by their impact. First, I'll update the plan step statu
ses. We've completed the "Inspect Jekyll config and layouts" step. Next, we‚Äôve a
lso audited the robots.txt and sitemap setup, as well as scanned the posts for n
oindex or excludes, which are all done.

For the "Identify root causes blocking indexing" step, that's also finished. Now
, I'll mark the first three steps as complete and identify the next steps. I‚Äôll
keep the order consistent while marking "Propose concrete fixes" as in progress
and update the plan.

**Summarizing proposed changes**

I'm looking to summarize root causes and recommend specific file changes. Since
I can't apply patches directly due to read-only access, I can suggest some diffs
 to implement.

First, for `_includes/head.html`, I want to update the title tag, consider addin
g a robots meta tag, adjust the canonical link, fix URLs, and possibly add OpenG
raph tags.

Secondly, I'll enable the `jekyll-sitemap` plugin and adjust the `_config.yml`.
Lastly, I need to ensure all posts have the correct layout defined for consisten
cy.**Outlining further changes**

I'm considering adding `permalink: /blog/` to `blog.html` so that the canonical
and Sitemap match. I need to fix the links in `blog.html` to use `{{ post.url |
relative_url }}` or `| absolute_url`.

For generated blog posts, unique titles are already set in the posts, but they n
eed to reflect in the head. I'll ensure the `robots.txt` includes `Sitemap: http
s://lukin.io/sitemap.xml` for better discovery.

Additionally, adding the `jekyll-seo-tag` plugin can help generate meta tags. Ho
wever, I just want to keep things simple: fix titles, add missing layouts, inclu
de the sitemap plugin, and link it in robots. After summarizing root causes, I'l
l clarify the concrete fixes and next steps, including checking coverage statuse
s in GSC.**Finalizing the update plan**

I think I can mark "Identify root causes" as completed. Since I'm preparing to p
rovide the full response now, I can also mark the plan's final step as completed
. It feels like a good idea to label my last steps as completed to clarify progr
ess. I‚Äôll ensure everything is neatly wrapped up in this answer. Once I finalize
 my updates, it should reflect a clear and organized completion of the tasks!

codex
I‚Äôve reviewed the repo and built output to pinpoint why posts aren‚Äôt being index
ed well.

**What I Found**
- Title tags: All pages use the same `<title>{{ site.title }}</title>`. Posts do
n‚Äôt get their own titles, which hurts indexing and CTR.
- One post missing layout: `_posts/2025-07-24-debugging-devise-jwt.md` has no `l
ayout: post`, so it renders without any `<head>`, `<title>`, or canonical. That
page is low quality to crawlers.
- Sitemap: The repo has a static `sitemap.xml` that‚Äôs stale and incomplete. It d
oesn‚Äôt reliably list all posts and ‚Äúlastmod‚Äù values look wrong. This weakens dis
covery.
- Canonicals: The canonical is rendered as `{{ page.url | prepend: site.baseurl
| prepend: site.url }}` (good), but:
  - For `blog.html` the canonical becomes `https://lukin.io/blog.html`, while yo
ur internal links and sitemap use `/blog`. Not fatal, but a mismatch.
  - In local build output, canonicals pointed to `http://localhost:4000` (likely
 dev build). On production it should be `https://lukin.io`.
- Feed/CSS URLs: In `_includes/head.html` the strings for feed and CSS have a le
ading space (`" /feed.xml"` and `" /css/main.css"`), producing malformed URLs in
 head. Not critical for indexing, but sloppy.
- Blog list links: `blog.html` uses `<a href="{{ post.url }}">` which should res
olve fine; it produces extensionless links to posts (OK).
- Robots: `robots.txt` allows all, but doesn‚Äôt link to your sitemap.

**Likely Root Causes For Poor Indexing**
- Non-unique titles across all pages severely degrades indexing of posts.
- A post without layout/head makes Google reluctant to index it.
- Static, outdated sitemap doesn‚Äôt include all posts or accurate timestamps.
- Small canonical and URL inconsistencies reduce crawl clarity.

**Minimal Fixes (high impact first)**
- Make titles unique per page/post:
  - Edit `_includes/head.html`:
    - Change `<title>{{ site.title }}</title>` to:
      - `{% if page.title %}<title>{{ page.title }} | {{ site.title }}</title>{%
 else %}<title>{{ site.title }}</title>{% endif %}`
    - Optionally switch canonical to the simpler `{{ page.url | absolute_url }}`
 for consistency.
- Ensure all posts get the `post` layout:
  - Add defaults in `_config.yml`:
    - defaults:
      - scope: { path: "", type: "posts" }
        values: { layout: "post" }
  - Or add `layout: post` to any post missing it (notably `2025-07-24-debugging-
devise-jwt.md`).
- Replace static sitemap with jekyll-sitemap:
  - Gemfile: add `gem 'jekyll-sitemap'`
  - `_config.yml`: add `plugins: [jekyll-sitemap]`
  - Remove `sitemap.xml` from the repo (the plugin will generate a fresh one aut
omatically in `_site/sitemap.xml`).
  - Update `robots.txt` to include the sitemap line:
    - `Sitemap: https://lukin.io/sitemap.xml`
  - In `_includes/head.html`, remove the leading space in the feed and CSS hrefs
:
    - `href="{{ "/feed.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}"`
    - `href="{{ "/css/main.css" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"`
- Optional tidy-ups:
  - Give `blog.html` a clean URL by adding `permalink: /blog/` to its front matt
er, so canonical and internal links agree.
les, descriptions, OpenGraph/Twitter cards:
    - Gemfile: `gem 'jekyll-seo-tag'`
    - `_config.yml`: `plugins: [jekyll-seo-tag, jekyll-sitemap]`
    - Replace manual meta in `head.html` with `{% seo %}` or combine as needed.

**Specific File Changes**
- `_includes/head.html`
  - Title: use page title when present.
  - Canonical: prefer `{{ page.url | absolute_url }}`.
  - Fix feed and css hrefs (remove leading spaces).
- `_config.yml`
  - Add defaults for posts layout.
  - Add `plugins: [jekyll-sitemap]` (and optionally `jekyll-seo-tag`).
- Gemfile
  - Add `gem 'jekyll-sitemap'` (and optionally `jekyll-seo-tag'`).
- `_posts/2025-07-24-debugging-devise-jwt.md`
  - Add `layout: post` to front matter if not using defaults.
- `robots.txt`
  - Add `Sitemap: https://lukin.io/sitemap.xml`.
- Remove `sitemap.xml` (static) from the repo.

**Validation Checklist**
- Rebuild locally, then check:
  - Each post HTML has a unique `<title>` including the post‚Äôs title.
  - `<link rel="canonical">` on posts resolves to `https://lukin.io/blog/<slug>`
 (or `<slug>.html`) consistently.
  - `_site/sitemap.xml` exists and includes all post URLs with reasonable `<last
mod>`.
  - `robots.txt` contains the `Sitemap:` line.
  - Feed link is valid and loads, CSS link resolves.
- In Google Search Console:
  - Submit `https://lukin.io/sitemap.xml`.
  - Use URL Inspection for a few posts; request indexing.
  - Monitor Coverage ‚Üí ‚ÄúExcluded‚Äù reasons. If you see ‚ÄúDuplicate, Google chose d
ifferent canonical‚Äù or ‚ÄúCrawled - currently not indexed‚Äù, the title and canonica
l fixes usually help.

Want me to implement these changes via a patch? I can update the head, config, G
emfile, add the default post layout rule, and provide the sitemap/robots tweaks.

**Proposing changes for GitHub Pages**

I see that the repo includes the _site directory, which suggests they might be h
osting through GitHub Pages using a static build. In this case, adding plugins m
ight not work unless GitHub Pages builds them. I think proposing minimal changes
 without needing a gem is wise: I can fix titles, add post defaults, and adjust
robots.txt now, while holding off on the sitemap for later. They asked about rig
hts, so I‚Äôll confirm we need write permission to implement these changes.

codex
Great question. A few ways you can let me apply the fixes automatically:

- Approve an edit when I send a patch: I‚Äôll propose a single patch changing thes
e files: `_includes/head.html`, `_config.yml`, `Gemfile`, `robots.txt`, and one
post front‚Äëmatter; and remove the static `sitemap.xml`. Your terminal will promp
t to approve write access‚Äîjust approve and it‚Äôll apply.
- Switch sandbox to allow writes: In your session controls, set Filesystem to wo
rkspace-write (or danger-full-access). Then I can patch without prompts.
- Manual apply: I can generate a git-compatible patch you can apply with `git ap
ply` if you prefer not to change sandbox settings.

If you‚Äôre good with the first option, say ‚ÄúProceed,‚Äù and I‚Äôll submit the patch for approval.
