      target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coronavirus pandemic</a> forced many to work from their homes.
    </p>

    <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samantharadocchia/2018/07/31/50-of-the-us-workforce-will-soon-be-remote-heres-how-founders-can-manage-flexible-working-styles/#41652cee5767" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to an estimate in <em>Forbes</em></a>, in 2018, 50 percent of the U.S. workforce was projected to be remote; across the pond, <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/how-remote-working-is-transforming-business-culture-in-europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Europe’s remote workers</a> have grown from 7.7 percent to 9.8 percent in the past decade. Providing employees with the flexibility to work where and when they want cuts across all industries and company sizes. In fact, many of today’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2019/04/05/here-are-the-top-23-companies-for-remote-jobs/#4ba094013700" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">top companies</a> offer full, half, or <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/growth-innovation/pabst-brewing-company-case-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">partial remote work</a>. Working remotely doesn’t always mean “<a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/worklife/how-to-work-from-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from home</a>,” either; it can apply anytime an employee works off-site—whether that’s at a coffee shop or a <a href="https://www.wework.com/workspace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flexible workspace</a>.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, working remotely allows for increased flexibility and autonomy for employees. <a href="https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/eliminate-this-huge-expense-youll-vastly-boost-morale-productivity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to <em>Inc.</em>,</a> nine out of 10 workers who currently work remotely plan to do so for the rest of their careers. Technology such as <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/worklife/best-video-conferencing-software" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">videoconferencing software</a>, <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/growth-innovation/slack-case-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collaboration platforms</a>, and cloud services <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/worklife/how-to-host-a-virtual-conference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">keep people connected</a> and allow them to have <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/growth-innovation/how-to-run-a-productive-virtual-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meetings</a> and complete projects from anywhere, anytime. But it’s not just employees who benefit: Employers are starting to view remote work as an important part of hiring and <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/office-design-space/office-space-top-talent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retaining top talent</a>, staying competitive in their field, and even saving on business costs.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Let’s take a look at the benefits of remote work for both employees and employers.</p>

    <h6>1. <strong>Working remotely allows for better work-life balance</strong></h6>

    <p>For many businesses, even a couple of decades ago, working remotely would have been nearly impossible. Without the right technology, an employee had to go to the office to get their work done. The downside to these technological advances? <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/worklife/how-do-i-handle-video-chat-burnout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blurred lines between work and home</a> life. So maintaining a healthy work-life balance is top of mind for so many employees. The ability to balance these two worlds has become the key to feeling happier and <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/8-ways-to-be-more-productive-counterintuitive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more productive</a> while at work. Saving time that would <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/growth-innovation/microsoft-productivity-wework" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">otherwise be spent on a long commute</a> allows employees to have better work-life balance and adds hours back into their days.&nbsp;</p>

    <h6>2. <strong>Remote employees have more freedom</strong></h6>

    <p>It’s clear that the advantages of remote work help keep employees happy, engaged, and fulfilled. According to Gallup’s <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236375/engaged-remote-workforce.aspx?g_source=link_newsv9&amp;g_campaign=item_206033&amp;g_medium=copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">State of the American Workplace</a> report, “The optimal engagement boost occurs when employees spend [around] three to four days working off-site.” Need to take a trip across the country to visit family? Or be home in the afternoon to attend a child’s soccer game? A traditional employee would need to request time off in order to do so. But a remote employee can still clock in from home or a regional <a href="https://www.wework.com/workspace/private-office/headquarters-by-wework" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">headquarters</a> at their destination, as well as check in, as needed. From working from home to traveling abroad to being in the office one day a week or three, employees enjoy the freedom of remote work.</p>

    <h6>3. <strong>Being a remote employee promotes employee well-being</strong></h6>

    <p>With no commute, no lunch rush, and no long hours in the office away from family or friends, working remotely can improve the health and wellness of employees by reducing stress—and limiting exposure to potentially sick coworkers. But employers shouldn’t skip a wellness plan in the remote workplace; <a href="https://www.wellright.com/blog/encouraging-corporate-wellness-in-the-remote-workplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inclusion in company wellness programs</a>, such as access to the gym, is just as important for those with a flexible work schedule.</p>

    <h6>4. <strong>Remote work equals an increase in productivity</strong></h6>

    <p>Employers today are grappling with an existential question for the ages: “If I don’t see my employees working, are they?” The ability for employers to <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/heres-why-trust-is-key-when-embracing-a-flexible-workplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trust their teams</a>, even when they work out of the office, could be key to driving more productivity than ever before. Data shows that when employees are able to skip the extra coffee breaks, a long commute, and any other distractions to focus on their work, <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/worklife/does-productivity-increase-when-working-remotely" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">productivity</a> reigns supreme. For example, in Stanford University’s two-year remote work productivity study, the researchers followed 500 employees after dividing them into “remote” and “traditional” working groups. The remote working group results not only showed a <a href="https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/a-2-year-stanford-study-shows-astonishing-productivity-boost-of-working-from-home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work productivity</a> boost equal to a full day’s work, but also fewer sick days and a 50 percent decrease in employee attrition.</p>

    <h6>5. <strong>Working remotely saves companies money</strong></h6>

    <p>Having fewer employees in the office also <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/financial-reasons-why-businesses-choose-wework" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reduces costs for a business</a>. How? Imagine a traditional office space. Do you see a thriving, energetic work center, or are you imagining some of the desks sitting empty, waiting to be filled with next year’s hires? That ghost town effect is real—and could be costing your company thousands in wasted spending. With fewer people in the office, companies can condense their real estate footprint, allowing for <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/measuring-for-workplace-efficiency-consider-your-people-first" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more efficient workspace usage</a>. That same Stanford study of remote workers allowed the participating company to save nearly $2,000 per employee on its office space rent, simply by using the space more efficiently.</p>

    <h6><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Offering remote work makes businesses more competitive</strong></h6>

    <p>Regardless of product, mission, or business goals, it’s the people who drive business success. Who, other than your employees, will shape the products of the future, drive the efficiency of your teams, and see through the growth and health of your business plan? Because of that, the ability to attract and <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/the-talent-wars-new-table-stakes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retain top talent</a> is a key differentiator in today’s competitive business world. Remote work can play a positive role in this arena, offering a sense of personal recognition between employer and employee. In fact, <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236372/manage-employees-rarely.aspx?g_source=link_newsv9&amp;g_campaign=item_207539&amp;g_medium=copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">35 percent of employees</a> would change jobs if it meant the ability to work off-site full-time, according to Gallup. Companies that offer a flexible working arrangement, such as full, half, or partial remote work, could make the difference for a candidate selecting their next career move.</p>

    <h6><strong>What to consider before embracing remote work</strong></h6>

    <p>By now you’ve seen that remote work offers increased flexibility and autonomy for employees, as well as increased worker productivity and cost savings for employers. But, before venturing into the world of remote work, businesses must take a look at their current office culture, team sizes, and business goals.</p>

    <ul><li>What work expectations will <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/growth-innovation/16-tips-for-managing-remote-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">managers set</a> with their remote teams?&nbsp;</li><li>Are there workplace measures in place, such as technology to conduct videoconferences, to facilitate seamless remote work?&nbsp;</li><li>Have programs been created that <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/worklife/make-remote-office-workers-feel-like-part-of-the-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">engage remote employees</a> in the company culture and make them feel included in the day-to-day business?&nbsp;</li></ul>

    <p>These are important questions for a business to consider before changing its current employment structure.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, before accepting a role that includes remote work or <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/how-do-i-ask-my-boss-to-let-me-work-remotely" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asking their managers</a> to allow them to work remotely, employees should consider their own work-life boundaries. Employees may want to ask themselves, “Can I thrive as a remote worker? Will I be able to structure my days efficiently? Is my company technologically enabled to support my working remotely?”&nbsp;</p>

    <p>More than a mere workplace trend, the concept of working from anywhere at any time is the future state of work. Technology is going to become more advanced and bring us all virtually ever closer together. It will continue to connect us as employees and <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/enterprise-companies-benefit-from-wework" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">businesses</a> across time zones and continents. We all may not be physically in the same room, but work can be just as effective, if not more so, than the traditional working model. It’s time for employers and employees alike to embrace the new world of work and to consider the benefits of working remotely.</p>

<!--     <h5>You Get More Done</h5>

    <p>
      Shorter commutes, private office, flexible work hours. This all leads to less time wasted, more productive work hours, and increased happiness among employees.
    </p>

    <p>

      In 2013, Stanford University conducted a study by randomly assigning employees at a call center to work from home and others to work in the office for nine months. The result was a 13% performance increase by those working from home, of which 9% was from working more hours.
    </p>

    <p>
      People criticize working remotely because they find it difficult to measure the number of hours their employees are working. What they forget is that going into the office does not equal productive work.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Office workers are interrupted–or self-interrupted–roughly every three minutes.”  –  The Wall Street Journal
      In fact, once thrown off, it can take over 23 minutes for a worker to retrieve focus on their original task.
    </p>

    <p>
      Give people the freedom to work where they want and begin to re-think the 9-5 working style. By adopting a culture of trust and respect, you’re empowering individuals to not just show up, but to show results.
    </p>

    <h5>The Best Talent Is Everywhere</h5>

    <p>
      <strong>We hear it over and over again: always hire the best people.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      The companies that embrace telecommuting have a significant advantage over those that haven’t figured it out. For each candidate that is available to work in your city, there are hundreds more around the world that can do it better.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hiring top talent is already hard enough as it is, so why limit the single most important ingredient for the success of your business?
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s inevitable that more and more skilled workers will adapt to a remote working lifestyle, and it’s the companies that can accommodate the lifestyles of these talents that will become the market leaders in the future.
    </p>

    <h5>It’s Never Been Easier</h5>

    <p>
      The good news is that it’s now easier than ever to coordinate the work of individuals from around the world. As long as we have access to a laptop and the internet, there are hundreds of tools that have been created to make the process seamless.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, I’m not suggesting that it’s a walk in the park. There are setbacks to working remotely. Some things are simply easier with in-person interactions, such as training, instant feedback, and relationship building.
