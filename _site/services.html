          <p>Agile development has evolved quickly over the last 20 years, thanks to new methods and tools that make it easier
            to innovate rapidly.</p>
          <p>It provides a way for developers, designers and managers to focus on providing the best product to their customers
            through feedback, iteration, collaboration and adaptability.</p>
          <p style="">For the web, the agile process has provided a fundamental shift in how we deliver products to our users.
            Let's examine what's involved.</p>

          <p>Most of us are familiar with and have experience of the traditional waterfall approach to creating a website, where
            the stages are defined as milestones, with a clear start and end date.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Waterfalls usually consist of four phases: discovery, design, development and deployment. In the discovery phase,
            we tend to talk with the client's stakeholders, usually staff or board members that wanted to give input and
            examples of what they liked for us to follow. Rarely does this stage involve talking with actual customers to get
            their input.</p>
          <p>The design phase uses the outcomes of the discovery to create compositions, usually of a complete page design with
            often limited rounds of revisions. This is followed by the development phase, which takes the completed page-design
            comps and builds them to spec, making sure that every pixel is in the proper place in order to execute the masterful
            vision of the designer.</p>
          <p>And finally the deployment phase starts, usually with a beta launch in which quality assurance is carried out on
            the site for a few weeks. It then launches to the public, sometimes with a beta signifier on the logo as a badge of
            honour.</p>
          <p>The problem with this is that all of your discovery happens weeks, maybe even months, before anything is actually
            put in front of a customer. Often the features that we assumed would be awesome fall flat once the users are able to
            interact with them, making our entire effort a partial waste of time and money.</p>
          <p>This waterfall process is often cumbersome, costly, time-consuming and demeaning to the real people who need the
            product: the customers.</p>

          <p>The modern-day agile development process was sparked by the 2001 <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/"
              rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-track-type="click" data-index="2" data-component="Inline links"
              data-count="18" class="hawk-link-parsed">Agile Manifesto</a>. It was penned by 17 developers who were fed up with
            over-controlling management and outdated feature requirements that didn't focus on what the user wanted or needed.
          </p>
          <p>The Manifesto has four key beliefs that provide the foundation of the agile movement as we know it today:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
            <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
            <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
            <li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Even though the Manifesto was born in the early 21st century, it grew from previous development methodologies as
            far back as the mid-20th century that were agile in nature, such as feature-driven development (FDD), extreme
            programming (XP) and even Scrum.</p>
          <p>Each of these beliefs have tools and resources that make it easy for you to put them in place right now.</p>
          <h2 id="01-individuals-and-interactions">01. Individuals and interactions</h2>
          <p>A focus on the people that use our products and how they use them is extremely important. In the past, other
            methods like waterfall have neglected the user and outright ignored their humanity. Human-centred design, also known
            as design thinking or agile design, focuses on making us get out of our chairs to interact with people and see how
            individuals use our product.</p>
          <p>There are three key areas of human-centred design: observation, analysis and ideation. Within these areas are some
            examples that might be familiar, like one-on-one interviews (observation), personas (analysis), or prototyping
            (ideation), to name a few.</p>

          <p>We shouldn't wait for a product to be perfect before sharing it with the world. Customers value transparency and

          <p>An often-used buzzword you'll hear that embodies the ideals of working software is minimum viable product or MVP.
            The concept is that we should ship early and often so the product gets in front of real users to test and improve.

          <h2 id="03-customer-team-collaboration">03. Customer/team collaboration</h2>
          <p>Your users want to feel heard and acknowledged, especially when your product frustrates them. Creating a culture of
            collaboration can help you connect to these customers in ways you never thought possible.</p>
          <p>A great way to start collaborating with users is to invite them to provide feedback on features that have not been
            released to the general public yet. This gives you the chance to get an assessment of how well the features work
            while giving the customer a sense of inclusion.</p>
          <div class="slot-double-height-furniture-1"></div>
          <figure>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The development methodology is sensitive to design decisions and ideally, said decisions would be best made as
                teams</p>
              <figcaption><cite>Henri Helvetica, web performance analyst</cite></figcaption>
            </blockquote>
          </figure>
          <p>Another important way to collaborate is to ensure your team and customer testing segments are a diverse group of
            people. Create a culture of inclusion that focuses on all ethnicities, genders and abilities. There have been many
            horror stories in the tech industry where a lack of inclusion ended up alienating a core demographic and ultimately
            causing the death of a product. Create a culture of inclusion from the beginning and always keep working at
            improving it.</p>
          <p>At the 2018 generate New York conference, Dan Mall made an excellent presentation on the importance of creating a
            common language and trust between your designers and developers. In his talk, Dan equated a roller coaster to the
            importance of creating a shared experience among the team to design, build and test together – both early and often.

          <p>The needs of our customers are ever evolving. What worked last year will need to work even better and faster this
            year. Customers come to expect improvement.</p>
          <p>To handle this, the agile process forces us to measure what works. Tools like Google Analytics provide a
            quantitative understanding of where users are going on your site, while something like <a href="https://hotjar.com"
              rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-track-type="click" data-index="7" data-component="Inline links"

            provides heatmaps, user recordings and several other features that shows how a customer interacts with your product.

                feedback to make sure the thing you built is actually accomplishing your goals</p>

            through questions and talk to you with their microphone as their screen is captured on video. This can become an
            invaluable asset to gather feedback from a wide array of customers.</p>

          <p>Scrum is an agile framework that outlines the roles of team members, assembles a list of needs called a backlog,
            defines how to handle sprints, sets a method of reviewing sprints after completion and many other useful tools.</p>

          <p>We've outlined several ways you can utilise agile methodologies in your work but keep in mind that it's more
            important you focus on processes than allegiance to specific tools. Take it upon yourself to seek out ways to
            introduce more collaboration, testing, and measurement into your work. Outline what you want to accomplish and the
            tools will fall into place as necessary to help you iterate your way to success.</p>
