        <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> &mdash; is a open-source framework based on <strong>Ruby</strong> for building
        web
        applications. It allows programmers to use
        readymade solutions to common issues, which means they can save time — and money - during the development
        process.
      </p>

      <p class="fs-5">
        <strong>Ruby</strong>'s flexibility and the abundance of ready solutions to common problems have contributed to
        Ruby being an easy choice
        for startups, where time and other resources are particularly limited: according to specialists, a Ruby on Rails
        team
        needs 30-40% less time to build an application than teams using other technologies.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-12">
      <p class="fs-5">
        <strong>Large Community</strong>
        Rails is more than a development tool; it is a large community of dedicated developers. Members share
        their work, often use the same tools, and support each other. The informal community provides a diversity of
        jobs,
        recruiters, meetups, conferences, examples of businesses building websites with Rails, and clients funding
        startups.
        It
        is no surprise that Rails is popular on the social coding resource Github, which is a great source of support
        for
        beginners.
      </p>

      <p class="fs-5">
        <strong>Availability of gems</strong>
        A “gem” is a software package that contains a Ruby app or library. Commonly it is used to extend
        or modify functionality in Ruby apps. Some “gems” provide command line utilities to help automate tasks and
        speed
        up
        the
        developer`s work. They are all publicly available at RubyGems.
      </p>


      <p class="fs-5">
        <strong>Cost-effective</strong>
        The process of building functionality with Rails is fast because it has a collection of open source code
        available within the community as well as a set of existing conventions. Ruby on Rails also runs on a free
        operating
        system and works with most free databases and web servers. These features mean fewer development hours, faster
        development process, and a lower overall cost.
      </p>

      <p class="fs-5">
        <strong>Code Quality</strong>
        Rails uses the Ruby programming language, which has a high level of readability. This aspect increases
        productivity and reduces the need to write separate documentation or comments, which makes it easier for other
        developers to pick up existing projects.
      </p>

      <p class="fs-5">
        <strong>Testing</strong>
        Rails was developed with a focus on testing and has good built-in testing frameworks.
      </p>

      <p class="fs-5">
        <strong>Diversity of tools</strong>
        Rails provides a tremendous variety of tools that help developers deliver more features in less
        time. For example, there are built-in templates for common functions and solutions.
      </p>

      <p class="fs-5">
        <strong>Flexibility</strong>
        One of the biggest benefits of using Ruby on Rails is that it is highly flexible and interacts easily with
        technologies and frameworks like AngularJS or ReactJs. This factor offers developers the opportunity to separate
        layers of the app
        and use multiple technologies.
