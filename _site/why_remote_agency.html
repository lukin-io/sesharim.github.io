    <h5>You Get More Done</h5>

    <p>
      Shorter commutes, private office, flexible work hours. This all leads to less time wasted, more productive work hours, and increased happiness among employees.
    </p>

    <p>

      In 2013, Stanford University conducted a study by randomly assigning employees at a call center to work from home and others to work in the office for nine months. The result was a 13% performance increase by those working from home, of which 9% was from working more hours.
    </p>

    <p>
      People criticize working remotely because they find it difficult to measure the number of hours their employees are working. What they forget is that going into the office does not equal productive work.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Office workers are interrupted–or self-interrupted–roughly every three minutes.”  –  The Wall Street Journal
      In fact, once thrown off, it can take over 23 minutes for a worker to retrieve focus on their original task.
    </p>

    <p>
      Give people the freedom to work where they want and begin to re-think the 9-5 working style. By adopting a culture of trust and respect, you’re empowering individuals to not just show up, but to show results.
    </p>

    <h5>The Best Talent Is Everywhere</h5>

    <p>
      <strong>We hear it over and over again: always hire the best people.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      The companies that embrace telecommuting have a significant advantage over those that haven’t figured it out. For each candidate that is available to work in your city, there are hundreds more around the world that can do it better.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hiring top talent is already hard enough as it is, so why limit the single most important ingredient for the success of your business?
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s inevitable that more and more skilled workers will adapt to a remote working lifestyle, and it’s the companies that can accommodate the lifestyles of these talents that will become the market leaders in the future.
    </p>

    <h5>It’s Never Been Easier</h5>

    <p>
      The good news is that it’s now easier than ever to coordinate the work of individuals from around the world. As long as we have access to a laptop and the internet, there are hundreds of tools that have been created to make the process seamless.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, I’m not suggesting that it’s a walk in the park. There are setbacks to working remotely. Some things are simply easier with in-person interactions, such as training, instant feedback, and relationship building.
