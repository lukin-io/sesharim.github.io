  <h1>Hello, i'm Max Lukin</h1>

  <div class="prose">
    <p class="lead">
      I'm just finished working for Apple as a Staff Software Engineer.
    </p>

    <p>
      I help businesses and companies grow by providing consulting, development, and support through effective
      software
      engineering practices. <br />
      I oversee the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects, ensuring they align
      with
      business goals and timelines while offering cost-effective solutions <strong>remotely</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I specialize in transforming ideas into reality, from <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="_blank"><strong>MVP</strong></a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept" target="_blank"><strong>proof-of-concept</strong></a>
      projects to fully functional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service"
        target="_blank"><strong>SaaS</strong></a>
      products. <br />
      My interests include large-scale web services, operational practices
      like
      on-call and monitoring, developer tools, and engineering leadership.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have been focused on <strong>AI</strong> since its early stages and have gained valuable
      experience building SaaS/Agents applications powered
      by <strong>AI</strong> using <a href="https://nextjs.org" target="_blank"><strong>Next.js</strong></a> and <a
        href="https://react.dev" target="_blank"><strong>React.js</strong></a>. <br />
      I also enjoy working on projects involving <a href="https://react.dev"
        target="_blank"><strong>JavaScript/TypeScript</strong></a> <a href="https://rubyonrails.org"
        target="_blank"><strong>Ruby on
          Rails</strong></a>, and
      <a href="https://go.dev" target="_blank"><strong>Golang</strong></a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      With over <strong>14 years</strong> of experience as a software engineer, Iâ€™ve contributed to
      high-impact projects across major sectors,
      including developing solutions for leading medical corporations and working on a facial recognition project with
      the UK Metropolitan Police Force for crime detection and prevention.
