    <p>Hi Ryan,</p>

    <p>Thank you for sharing the Executive Bonus Agreement.</p>

    <p>
      I’m aligned with the intent, and I understand that Series A outcomes depend on investors and market conditions,
      so I’m not expecting guarantees beyond what’s realistic for a startup.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before signing, I’d like to clarify several points to ensure expectations are objective and aligned upfront.
      All documents were reviewed with my personal legal counsel (22+ years of experience), and the same items were
      flagged as important to address directly in the agreement.
    </p>

    <h3>Context (why clarity matters)</h3>

    <p>Over the past 8 months, I’ve made a substantial commitment to Wigiwork:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Compensation trade-off:</strong> I joined at <strong>$6,000/month</strong>, after previously earning
        <strong>$12,000–$13,000/month</strong> (including bonuses), and incurred a <strong>$9,000</strong> loss from
        leaving Apple early under a yearly contract.</li>
      <li><strong>Bonus trade-off:</strong> I gave up a <strong>$15,000</strong> year-end bonus — the only role in my
        <strong>~15-year</strong> career without one.</li>
      <li><strong>Sustained workload:</strong> Since day one, I’ve worked late nights and <strong>full weekends</strong>,
        with <strong>no vacations, days off, paid sick leave, or insurance</strong>, to keep backend delivery unblocked.
        I’m currently the <strong>sole backend engineer</strong> supporting <strong>3 AI engineers</strong> and
        <strong>5–6 frontend engineers</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Opportunity cost:</strong> The compensation delta over 8 months is approximately
        <strong>$96,000</strong>, plus paused side income of roughly <strong>$30,000+</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Strategic impact:</strong> I strongly advocated for <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> over
        <strong>Golang</strong>, enabling a production-ready API in months rather than mid-next year.</li>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> I remain based in <strong>Ukraine</strong> during the ongoing war. Since
        <strong>December 26</strong>, following a major rocket attack, there has been <strong>no heating</strong>,
        intermittent hot water, and unstable electricity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Given the sustained base-compensation reduction, the bonus functions as a
      <strong>component of total compensation rather than a discretionary perk</strong>, which is why clarity here
      is particularly important.
    </p>

    <h3>Points requiring clarification</h3>

    <p><strong>1) Series A target and valuation basis</strong></p>
    <p>
      The bonus tiers are anchored to a <strong>$50M Series A</strong>, but the agreement does not clarify how the
      feasibility of that target is determined. Without an objective basis, it is possible for the market-supported
      outcome to be <strong>$20–30M</strong>, resulting in <strong>50% or zero bonus</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to explicitly separate <strong>individual performance from fundraising outcomes</strong>, which are
      driven by market conditions rather than execution alone.
    </p>

    <p><strong>2) “Satisfactory performance, as solely determined by the Company”</strong></p>
    <p>
      In a bonus agreement tied to a material amount, this formulation is problematic. As written, performance is
      not measured against
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator" target="_blank">KPIs</a>
      or
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results" target="_blank">OKRs</a>
      and depends entirely on unilateral determination.
    </p>

    <p><strong>3) Bad Leaver / “harms the Company’s interests”</strong></p>
    <p>
      If burnout or performance degradation results primarily from structural staffing decisions, it would be
      concerning if such outcomes could later be treated as unsatisfactory performance or harm to the Company’s
      interests.
    </p>

    <h3><strong>Closing</strong></h3>

    <p>
      What I’m asking for is not guarantees, but <strong>clear, objective, and balanced terms</strong> consistent with
      executive-level incentives.
    </p>

    <p>
      If aligning on all bonus-related points takes more time, I see a pragmatic way to restore balance and keep
      execution healthy:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Base compensation adjustment:</strong> A <strong>+25% increase</strong> to my current base salary
        to offset prolonged compensation reduction and stabilize my family budget.</li>
      <li><strong>Remote weekend work arrangement:</strong> I’m prepared to continue weekend support when needed,
        but <strong>remotely</strong>, as a <strong>2.5-hour daily commute</strong> is not sustainable.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I genuinely like the team and the product, and I’m fully committed to building Wigiwork. I’d appreciate
      aligning on this before execution continues much further.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for taking the time to review this.</p>

    <p>
      Best regards,<br/>
      Max K.
    </p>
