            Max was a key player in developing the Facewatch system as part of a large team which reduced over time for over 10 years. He was always extremely professional and a hard worker who as well as an exxellent team player. I was always impressed with his ability to explain complex issues clearly to those of us who are not as technically proficient.  His technical abilities came to the fore when we reduced a team of 13 down to just Max with one sysadmin and he was still able to maintain the system and fix bugs as well as deal with a significant system move to AWS.  I highly recommend Max to anyone wanting a good Ruby developer who has initiative and integrity as well as being a thoroughly nice person to work with.
