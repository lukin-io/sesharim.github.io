        Our website development process
        No two projects are the same, but our process has served us and our clients well across hundreds of website builds.

        tech discovery icon
        Technical Discovery
        Assessing the situation, goals, and requirements

        We begin by assessing your current environment and technology stack, speaking to your key stakeholders and tech leads.
        Our goal is to understand your business needs, and learn how these inform your technology requirements. If we’re also
        designing your website, technical discovery is part of an integrated discovery and strategy process.

        Planning
        Creating a tech strategy that works

        An optimal technology architecture requires a skillful balancing of factors – current and future needs, workflows,
        integrations, regulatory requirements, in-house technical resources and, of course, budget – to arrive at the right
        solution.

        Our experienced technology team acts as your strategic partners – helping you rebuild your tech stack or finding a
        solution that plays nicely with the tools you have.

        IA design and copywriting
        IA, Design + Copywriting
        Delivering a complete website solution

        We’re an end-to-end website development agency, so we are more than capable of handling your digital strategy,
        information architecture, website design, and content creation.

        We begin planning early for the features we know the site will need, so that we can scope development appropriately. And
        we architect and design the website with an understanding of the unique capabilities of the platform the site will be
        built on.

        front to back end coding
        Front- and Back-End Coding
        We find the majority of our clients prefer a hybrid development approach, where we build the MVP using a Waterfall
        methodology, and then add new features and improvements in Agile sprints, but we can and do work in other ways.

        Our development teams are fluent in the whole range of modern web development languages, including PHP, .Net, Java,
        HTML5, CSS and Javascript. With our range of partnerships, we have expertise – including many certifications – for a
        wide variety of CMS options.

        Every build is assigned a dedicated technical Project Manager, who will support your equally dedicated Account Director
        in efficiently managing work quality, time, and budget.

        QA icon
        QA
        Testing against over 100 checkpoints

        We’re fanatical about QA, with dedicated teams ruthlessly evaluating the site against over 100 checkpoints before it
        even gets close to going live.

        We like to get our clients involved – while the site is in beta, it lives on a development server, where you and your
        team can play with it, try to break it, and help us eradicate any bugs.

        cms training icon
        CMS Training + Launch
        Preparing your team for handover

        When we deliver your new site, we don’t just throw you the keys and run. We walk you through the CMS, show you how to
        use it (and how not to use it), and make sure everyone touching the website is comfortable with managing it. Launch day
        is time to celebrate – and to start planning enhancements that deliver even more value to your users and business.
