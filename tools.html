          <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> is an open-source framework based on <strong>Ruby</strong> for building
          web applications. It allows programmers to use ready-made solutions to common issues, which means they can save time — and money — during the development process.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Ruby</strong>'s flexibility and the abundance of ready solutions to common problems have contributed to
          Ruby being an easy choice for startups, where time and other resources are particularly limited. According to specialists, a Ruby on Rails
          team needs 30-40% less time to build an application than teams using other technologies.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Rails is more than a development tool; it is a large community of dedicated developers. Members share
          their work, often use the same tools, and support each other. The informal community provides a diversity of
          jobs, recruiters, meetups, conferences, examples of businesses building websites with Rails, and clients funding
          startups. It is no surprise that Rails is popular on the social coding resource GitHub, which is a great source of support for beginners.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          A "gem" is a software package that contains a Ruby app or library. Commonly it is used to extend
          or modify functionality in Ruby apps. Some "gems" provide command line utilities to help automate tasks and
          speed up the developer's work. They are all publicly available at RubyGems.

        <h3 class="font-display text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Cost-effective</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          The process of building functionality with Rails is fast because it has a collection of open source code
          available within the community as well as a set of existing conventions. Ruby on Rails also runs on a free
          operating system and works with most free databases and web servers. These features mean fewer development hours, faster
          development process, and a lower overall cost.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Rails uses the Ruby programming language, which has a high level of readability. This aspect increases
          productivity and reduces the need to write separate documentation or comments, which makes it easier for other
          developers to pick up existing projects.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Rails provides a tremendous variety of tools that help developers deliver more features in less
          time. For example, there are built-in templates for common functions and solutions.

      <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
        One of the biggest benefits of using Ruby on Rails is that it is highly flexible and interacts easily with
        technologies and frameworks like AngularJS or ReactJS. This factor offers developers the opportunity to separate
        layers of the app and use multiple technologies.
