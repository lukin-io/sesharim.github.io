      <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> &mdash; is a open-source framework based on <strong>Ruby</strong> for building web applications. It allows programmers to use
      readymade solutions to common issues, which means they can save time — and money - during the development process.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Ruby</strong>'s flexibility and the abundance of ready solutions to common problems have contributed to Ruby being an easy choice
      for startups, where time and other resources are particularly limited: according to specialists, a Ruby on Rails team
      needs 30-40% less time to build an application than teams using other technologies.

  </div>

  <div class="col-6">
    <h6>Don't Repeat Yourself:</h6>
    Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." In other
    words, applications are less buggy when the same information isn’t repeated over and over in the codebase.
  </div>
  <div class="col-6">
    <h6>Convention Over Configuration:</h6>
    In commercial product development, an MVP working application usually needs to be built as fast as possible. Rails
    makes
    it easier by providing default settings that drastically limit the amount of initial configuration.

    <h4>Other benefits of Ruby on Rails</h4>
    <h6>Large Community</h6>
    Rails is more than a development tool; it is a large community of dedicated developers. Members share
    their work, often use the same tools, and support each other. The informal community provides a diversity of jobs,
    recruiters, meetups, conferences, examples of businesses building websites with Rails, and clients funding startups. It
    is no surprise that Rails is popular on the social coding resource Github, which is a great source of support for
    beginners.
    <div class="clearfix">&nbsp;</div>


    <h6>Availability of gems</h6>
    A “gem” is a software package that contains a Ruby app or library. Commonly it is used to extend
    or modify functionality in Ruby apps. Some “gems” provide command line utilities to help automate tasks and speed up the
    developer`s work. They are all publicly available at RubyGems.
    <div class="clearfix">&nbsp;</div>


    <h6>Cost-effective</h6>
    The process of building functionality with Rails is fast because it has a collection of open source code
    available within the community as well as a set of existing conventions. Ruby on Rails also runs on a free operating
    system and works with most free databases and web servers. These features mean fewer development hours, faster
    development process, and a lower overall cost.
    <div class="clearfix">&nbsp;</div>


    <h6>Code Quality</h6>
    Rails uses the Ruby programming language, which has a high level of readability. This aspect increases
    productivity and reduces the need to write separate documentation or comments, which makes it easier for other
    developers to pick up existing projects.
    <div class="clearfix">&nbsp;</div>


    <h6>Testing</h6>
    Rails was developed with a focus on testing and has good built-in testing frameworks.
    <div class="clearfix">&nbsp;</div>


    <h6>Diversity of tools</h6>
    Rails provides a tremendous variety of tools that help developers deliver more features in less
    time. For example, there are built-in templates for common functions and solutions.
    <div class="clearfix">&nbsp;</div>


    <h6>Flexibility</h6>
    One of the biggest benefits of using Ruby on Rails is that it is highly flexible and interacts easily with
    technologies and frameworks like AngularJS or ReactJs. This factor offers developers the opportunity to separate layers of the app
    and use multiple technologies.
